# React Microfrontend App 🚀🔗

Welcome to the React Microfrontend App repository! This project is a demonstration of how to build a scalable and maintainable application using the microfrontend architecture with React.

## About the Project 📝

Microfrontends are a design approach where a front-end app is decomposed into individual, semi-independent "microapps" working loosely together. This project is a practical implementation of this concept using React. 

## Getting Started 🏁

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. 

## Running the Projects 🏃‍♂️

This repository consists of multiple projects that need to be run in a specific order. Here's how to do it:

1. **Project 1**: Navigate to the project 1 directory and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to start the project.

2. **Project 2**: After project 1 is running, navigate to the project 2 directory and run `npm install` and `npm start` in the same way.

3. **Project 3**: Finally, once both project 1 and 2 are running, you can start project 3. Navigate to the project 3 directory, run `npm install` and `npm start`.

Please ensure that each project is running on a different port to avoid conflicts.

## Architecture 🏗️

The architecture of this application is designed to enable you to work on individual features in isolation, without affecting the rest of the project. This is achieved by breaking down the application into multiple, smaller microapps.
